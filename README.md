# MLArt-Critic
A simple machine learning example that implements an art critic

Used as an example application for the Barclays AI Frenzy event. Based on examples from Microsoft.

Includes a slide deck that describes how the application works. 

Based on tutorial content from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ai/get-started-uwp) and [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/InsiderDevTour18)

May one day be a motion picture.  (actually it is now - take a look [here](https://youtu.be/-C8bm5kGDTI))
